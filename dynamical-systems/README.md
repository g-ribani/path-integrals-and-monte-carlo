### README

This directory contains the results of an (unreasonable) attempt to write quite elaborated C++
classes to study the path integrals for rather general dynamical systems. More practical 
approaches, and more genuinely object-oriented as well, will be found elsewhere in the project,
and will be used most.

The rudimental plotting script needs to be edited by hand, as some simulation parameters
and the path to data are hard-coded (look at log files produced by the main program).

**Requires** Boost and teh GSL.
